This repository aims to hold the solution to nodeschool.io workshops that i'm corrently working on, so if you have a better solution to the one in any file feel free to let me or if you have any question about one of the solution also contact me.

Note that i have being programming for 2 years at the time of this repository creation, and have only program in javascript for a couple of weeks. So the code might not be perfect.
